### *Project 1 : Smart City â€“ Road Mapping Between Regions using Graphs*
`Problem Statement`
> In a smart city, we need to model road connectivity between various regions (or neighborhoods). The system should:
> 1. Represent regions as nodes.
> 2. Represent roads as edges (with distances or travel time as weights).
> 3. Answer questions like:
>    1. Which regions are directly connected?
>    2. What is the shortest route from Region A to B?
>    3. Which regions are most connected?
>    4. What happens if a road is blocked? (resilience)
