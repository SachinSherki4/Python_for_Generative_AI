## List in Python
1. Built in python Data Structure, use to store collections of items(images, number, bool) and 
2. can access or modify using indexes
3. It is an Orders, mutable(can be change), allow duplucates.
4. Syntax : varible = [value1, value2]
5. represent using square brackets []
6. can create using list() functions
7. List Comprehension : new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]

## Use Case
1. Store predictions from ML models
2. Data preprocessing : In Machine Learning or Data Science, raw data is stored and manipulated using lists
3. Handling token lists in GenAI : In Natural Language Processing, lists are used to manage tokens:
