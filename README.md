# üß† Python for Generative AI & Machine Learning üöÄ

Welcome to my learning repository where I document everything I'm learning about **Python** ‚Äî specifically focused on **Generative AI**, **Machine Learning**, and solving real-world problems using practical coding techniques.

## üìå What's Inside?

This repo includes clean, beginner-friendly Python code examples and use cases that demonstrate how to:
- Master Python fundamentals with an AI/ML lens
- Understand data structures & algorithms for problem-solving
- Apply concepts from the `collections` module (like `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `OrderedDict`, `deque`)
- Explore searching and sorting algorithms with real-life applications
- Build reusable components for AI/ML workflows

> ‚ú® I‚Äôm constantly updating this repo as I progress in my journey.

## üí° Why This Repo?

While learning AI, I noticed a lack of **practical, step-by-step Python examples** tailored for beginners moving toward AI/ML. This repo fills that gap by:
- Explaining **why** we use a specific method or structure
- Showing real-world use cases and AI-friendly patterns
- Keeping everything readable, modular, and ready to reuse

## üì• How You Can Use This

Whether you're a:
- Beginner learning Python for AI/ML
- Developer brushing up on core concepts
- Someone building a GenAI side project

You can **fork, clone, or star ‚≠ê this repo** to:
- Practice core concepts
- Understand the logic behind AI workflows
- Build on top of this foundation
