#1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5.
# See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see

#break = 5  // Invalid Syntax - break is keyword and we can not use keyword as variable

#2. Create two variables. One to store your birth year and
# another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

birth_year=1996
current_year=2025
age=current_year-birth_year
print(f"My current Age is {age}") #29

#3. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and
# then print your full name using these variables

name='Sachin'
midle_name="N"
surname="Sherki"
print(f"My full name is {name} {midle_name} {surname}")
